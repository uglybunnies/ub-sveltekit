    <h2>Urban Forest: Theme Design for Sandvox</h2>
    <p>Sandvox drew inspiration from the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> and created one set of templates composed of the same markup structure and just "skinned" it with CSS. This is the Urban Forest theme I designed for them. This design has proven to be the most enduring design I have done. The design is still used in production by several websites (including <a href="http://luckydogcambridge.com/">this one</a> for example).</p>
