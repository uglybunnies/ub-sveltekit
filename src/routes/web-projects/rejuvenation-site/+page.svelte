    <h2>Rejuvenation Medi-Spas</h2>
    <p>This site was the second created in collaboration with my colleague who was attempting to build a business around creating websites optimized for <a class="slink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>. The site was never published because the client <a class="slink" href="https://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U">could not pay</a> after his partners refused to go forward. This project is the the last bit of unpaid "spec work" I have done. Lesson learned, I no longer do projects on spec.</p>
