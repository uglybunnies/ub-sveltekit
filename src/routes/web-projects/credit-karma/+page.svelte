      <h3>Credit Score Simulator</h3>
      <p>This feature allowed users to experience how some financial decisions could impact their credit score.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="group">
      <p class="decorate">The credit simulator incorporated the Velocity.js animation library to profide physics-based spring animations for the dial indicator used on the score display. Other animations were driven by CSS transforms and transitions, and jQuery animation functions.</p>

        <p>This two-page experience was created and launched ahead of the Super Bowl of that year.</p>
      </header>
      <div class="group switch">
        <p class="decorate-shift">The goal of the project was to promote content around building good credit. There were two pages; a landing page and an interactive infographic page. The landing page featured links to other original content and personal finance resources, a video detailing the importance of maintaining good credit practices, and a link to the infographic page. The infographic featured Slick.js carousels in different sections of the page to add some interactivity to the experience.</p>
