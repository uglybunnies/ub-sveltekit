    <h2>Satsuki Ina Website</h2>
    <p>This freelance project was a complete redesign of an existing site for the writer and activist; Satsuki Ina. The focus of the project was to replace a slow loading WordPress theme with a custom one that was streamlined  to be more performant. </p>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>

    <p>This site was built from the ground up and includes a custom-built WordPress theme, succinct and semantic HTML, and modern CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <h4>The Theme</h4>
    <p>The custom theme featured the use of custom fields to apply hero and featured images. Custom functions include the topnav menu and link list generator. Custom loops were developed to apply curated content to the homepage.</p>
    <h4>The Markup</h4>
    <p>Special care was applied to ensure that the markup was as shallow as possible since CMS systems like WordPress tend to have many nestings of sectioning markup. The resulting pages rendered markup that was sparse and incorporated recommended semantics to support accessiblility and SEO.</p>
    <h4>The CSS</h4>
    <p>This site was built to be mobile-friendly. Media queries are used to adjust the layout as the viewport expands or contracts. The "Lato" font was incorporated as a webfont sourced from Google Fonts to provide a simple and elegant typeface. CSS transitions were employed to manage the menu animations for mobile and desktop.</p>
    <h4>The JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript was used to run the menu including calculating the height of the main menu and the sub-menus for mobile so that the height could be animated via CSS transitions when they were expanded.</p>
