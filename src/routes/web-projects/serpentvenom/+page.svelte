<title>Ugly Bunniesâ€”SerpentVenom Website Design Overview</title>
</svelte:head>

<article class="project">

    <h2>SerpentVenom</h2>
    <p>This is the third and final design of my former website, SerpentVenom. SerpentVenom featured my art and design portfolios as well as my blog and some articles I had written. I retired the site when I realized I had not updated the blog in over a year.</p>

      <h3>The Design</h3>

  <section class="tech">
    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <h4>WordPress Theme</h4>
    <p>SerpentVenom was powered by WordPress using a custom theme that I developed from the ground up. Some of the custom development work included modifications and additions to the functions.php file, and custom loops on the homepage.</p>
    <h4>The Markup Structure</h4>
    <p>The markup was standards-compliant HTML5. The HTML generated by the theme was semantic and succinct to bolster SEO and rendering performance.</p>
    <h4>CSS</h4>
    <p>Hand-coded CSS provided the layouts, visual treatments like gradients, and transitions such as those used in the lightbox. This was the first project that I used flex to create layouts and that ultimately maded converting the site to a responsive design much simpler thanks to being able to alter the order of flex items via media queries.</p>
    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
    <p>Vanilla JavaScript was developed to run the Project Viewer on the project pages. This was essentially a tab interface that revealed the content panel associated with the selected tab.</p>
    
    <p>The Lightbox was also written in vanilla JavaScript. This script collected all of the anchor tags with a specific class name. Each anchor's HREF attribute was the location of the larger version of the thumnail image that the anchor contained. The ALT attribute of each thumbnail provided the caption of each image in the Lightbox itself. The navigation of the images in the lightbox was sequential and continuous, going back to the start if you reached the last image while going forward or backward.</p>
